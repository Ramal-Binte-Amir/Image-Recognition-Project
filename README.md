 **Image-Recognition-Project**
🐾 Cats vs. Dogs Classifier — Built with TensorFlow/Keras using both a custom CNN and MobileNetV2, achieving high accuracy through data augmentation, model tuning, and performance evaluation.
**Project Overview**
- The goal was to train and compare two models:
- Custom CNN — Built from scratch with Conv2D, Pooling, and Dense layers.
- MobileNetV2 — A pre-trained model fine-tuned for our dataset.
- We evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, along with visualizations for training progress.

**Dataset**
- **Source:** Kaggle — Cats and Dogs Dataset
- **Size:** ~2,000 training images (balanced classes)
- **Preprocessing:**
- Resized to 224x224 pixels
- Normalized pixel values to [0, 1]
- Applied data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom)

**Model Details**
- **Custom CNN**
- **Layers:** Conv2D → MaxPooling → Conv2D → MaxPooling → Flatten → Dense → Output
- **Optimizer:** Adam (lr=0.001)
- **Epochs:** 10

- **MobileNetV2**
- Pre-trained on ImageNet
- Fine-tuned final layers for binary classification
- **Optimizer:** Adam (lr=0.0001)
- **Epochs:** 5

**Key Learnings**
- Difference between building CNNs from scratch vs. using transfer learning
- Importance of preprocessing & augmentation
- Model evaluation beyond accuracy
